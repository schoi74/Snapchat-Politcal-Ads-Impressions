# Predicting Snapchat Political Advertisement Impressions
## Background
On July 21, 2020, Rachel Kraus published an [article](https://mashable.com/article/snapchat-political-ads-q2-2020-earnings/) on Mashable called _Snapchat hungry for political ads as Twitter, Facebook shy away_. In this article, Kraus elaborates on how Snapchat established their very own specific guidelines to have political advertisements after some of the company's rivals banned or stopped politcal ads, such as TikTok in October of 2019, Twitter within days after TikTok, Google restricting ad targeting demographics for political ads, and Facebook having some controversial methods of displaying political ads that inclues some false or misleading information. Unlike Facebook, "Snap does fact check political ads" and Jeremi Gorman, Snapchat's chief business officer, mentions that they have "very specific guidelines". As the presidential election is coming our way in a few months, can we predict the impressions that these ads created during a full year? Which factors can contribute to help predict the impressions of that year? We will delve more into the data provided by [Snapchat](https://www.snap.com/en-US/political-ads/) to further analyze the significant variables (spend, days of advertisement, and most common organization) to create a regression to ultimately predict the number of impressions that political ads formed during the years of 2020, 2019, and 2018.
## Business Question
_Can we predict the number of impressions for an advertisement for any year with the variables of dollars spent, days of advertisement, and the most common organization?_
## Data Question - Open Data
We'll use open data from one source:
- Snapchat: This research group constructs [publically open data "to find out details about all political and advocacy advertising running on our platform".](https://www.snap.com/en-US/political-ads/) We will be creating multiple linear regressions:
    
    i. 2020: Original open data on political advertisements in the year 2020.
    
    ii. 2019: Original open data on political advertisements in the year 2019.
    
    iii. 2018: Original open data on political advertisements in the year 2018.
## Data Question - Analysis
We will use Microsoft Excel to answer these questions:

- __How does the regression for the number of impressions from political ads in the year 2020 look like?__ Creating a multiple linear regression to predict the number of impressions with variables of spend, days, and the most common organization.

- __How does the regression for the number of impressions from political ads in the year 2019 look like?__ Creating a multiple linear regression to predict the number of impressions with variables of spend, days, and the most common organization.

- __How does the regression for the number of impressions from political ads in the year 2018 look like?__ Creating a multiple linear regression to predict the number of impressions with variables of spend, days, and the most common organization.
